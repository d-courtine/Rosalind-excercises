# Repo with my solutions to ROSALIND problems

[ROSALIND](http://rosalind.info/about/) is a "*platform for learning bioinformatics through problem solving*".

I'll update this file as we go along.

-----
Within each directory, you should find a `<file>.py` that contains the code I used.

Concernig the BioPtyhon, all classes, objects and so on can be found [here](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/api/Bio-module.html).
A [tutorial/documentation](http://biopython.org/) is also available.

I use a Conda environment when I run scripts containing BioPython module.
`source activate biopython` where `biopython` is a Conda environment.
